# flexcat-spiking - Flexible categorization dynamics in spiking neural networks of perceptual decision making

Spiking neural network simulations from the following paper:

> Prat-Ortega, G., Wimmer, K., Roxin, A. and de la Rocha, J. (2020). Flexible categorization in perceptual decision making. Nature Communications. In Press.

A complete description of the models is provided in the methods of the paper and the supplementary material.

The repository is organized into the following folders:
1. simulation: Code to run the neural network simulations. The network is implemented in [Brian2](https://briansimulator.org/) using Python 3. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/install.html). 
2. analysis: MATLAB scripts to collect the simulation data and to compute psychometric curves and psychophysical kernels.
3. results: Simulation results (psychometric curves and psychophysical kernels) and figures.

If you run into any issues when running the code please contact Klaus Wimmer (wimmer.klaus@gmail.com).
